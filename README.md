# Welcome to Break Bricks!

Hi! It's my first larger project with **[Kivy Framework](https://kivy.org/#home)**. Feel free to use my code in your own projects. I hope you'll find something useful for you herein.

## Kivy version:
I work with **Kivy 1.11**, but you can check if the code also works with older Kivy versions.

## Done:

 - main menu
 - creating bricks
 - using keyboard to move a paddle
 - removing a brick, when a ball hits one
 - a label with ball lives - you lose one life if a ball hits the bottom edge
 - a ball is on a paddle after losing life until you click 'Enter' in order to start a ball serve

## To Do:

- ~~to enhance ball bouncing off a paddle~~
- to add popup with Esc menu (buttons with 'Resume', 'Quit game')
- to add content to another screens
- to add next levels
- to add boosters e.g. doubled width of the paddle, the ball acceleration for limited time
